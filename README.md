The Expense Tracker project is designed to help users keep track of their purchases and expenses throughout the year. With this application, users can input their expenses, categorize them, and monitor their spending habits. The system analyzes the data and identifies the months that have higher expenses compared to others, providing valuable insights into spending patterns. By visualizing this information, users can gain a better understanding of their financial habits and make more informed decisions regarding budgeting and financial planning. The Expense Tracker project aims to promote financial awareness and responsibility by empowering individuals to take control of their expenses and achieve their financial goals.
